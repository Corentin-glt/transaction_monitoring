# Transaction Monitoring app üöÄ

This is the Transaction Monitoring repository.

> A Transaction Monitoring System (TMS) is a solution used by financial institutions and businesses to track, analyze, and detect potentially suspicious transactions in real-time or retrospectively. It helps ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and fraud prevention, by identifying patterns, anomalies, or behaviors that deviate from expected norms. TMS often leverages rules, machine learning, and risk-based approaches to automate monitoring and generate alerts for further investigation.
